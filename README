An efficient java List i designed back in my earlier days of programming (about 4 years ago)

Description/idea 

QuickListedList stores the elements internally as several arraylist of specified size.
It takes advantage of basic operations of both LinkedList and ArrayList thus
the list is not synchronized and at worst case, the performance is roughly equivalent
to that of either LinkedList or ArrayList.
 
Since the internal sublists are stored as ArrayLists, for operations such as add,
get, and indexOf, QuickLinkedList is almost equivalent to ArrayList in terms of performance.
However for operation such as add and remove to an index position, the QuickLinkedList can
be potentially several magnitudes faster than ArrayList and LinkedList.
 
QuickLinkedList is designed and optimized to handle large number of elements. In
fact, the default size of the sublist is 1000, which means for list containing less
than 1000 elements, the QuickLinkedList is essentially an ArrayList.
